# Exam-generator
A system of questions stock and creating tests automatically or manually.

During the course "Computer science Introduction" in Java we were asked to create a system for creating tests from a stock of questions that can be added each time.
We also used JAVA FX in part of the display. This project appears in the folder "original java program".
In the presentation there is a detailed explanation of each option in this system. 

In the Database Systems course,
We were asked to use this project while saving all data in a database system - MYSQL. We converted our entire project in java so that we work mainly with the SQL and therefore we do not need the classes that were previously in java. This project appears in the folder "sqlProgram".
In addition, in this folder there are sql files that include creating tables and inserting the data into the content.
In the presentation there is also an explanation about this and all the tables we created for the purpose of maintaining the data.

Note: The connection between java and MySQL requires a password on the initial screen when you run the project.
Therefore, in order to be able to see this project independently, you will have to copy the SQL files to your MySQL into a new schema you will create called exam_generator.
Then you can log in with your MySQL username and password.
